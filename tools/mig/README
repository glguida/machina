This is a fork of Mach3 MIG, modified to use Machina interface.

It is outdated compared to modern MIG implementations, but it's very
simple and easy to hack. The main interface is the 'mig' shell script,
that calls 'migcom' for the actual interface generation.

It supports both Machina and Mach 3 types.

See ChangeLog for more detailed changes.
